              <p>Construction projects involve many complex phases that need to be executed with
                adequate planning and precision. There shouldnâ€™t be any compromise when it comes
                to quality, durability and sustainability. We at Naxos make sure all these are met with
                our team of experts and industry leaders.
                </p>
              <p>We provide the mechanical, electrical & plumbing aspects and components required
                in a construction project. We consult specialised MEP engineers to choose the best
                design and an adept team for its installation. Under the mechanical category, we
                have its HVAC equipment, installation, erection & ducting along with fabrication and
                insulation. In the electrical category, we provide its designing, lighting & power
                distribution system, electrical substation, installation of switchgear, data cabling etc.
                Under plumbing services, we undertake installation, erection & insulation along with
                plumbing and drainage works and wastewater treatment. We also provide testing,
                commissioning and mechanical aspects of the fire fighting sector. In MEP, we go
                through the in-depth design and selection of these systems, which involves
                computer-aided design and 3D modelling to examine their structure & functionality
                and up-to-date documentation. We look into its technical safety and standards during
                installation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under MEP works we consider factors such as its design and functionality,
                prevention of location clashes, making it within the budget and performing the proper
                installation with proper consultation as this area is interrelated to many other
                construction sectors.

                <li>Designing</li>
                <p> Designing plays a crucial role in the mechanical aspects of construction. It is
                  important for planning, accurate documentation, performance and cost
                  estimation. This sector is looked after by a team of engineers specialising in
                  plans, prints, design specifications and experience in the MEP areas. We
                  design parts, components, products & systems of mechanical nature. These
                  are designed by considering its functions, safety, reliability & maintenance.
                  The entire process is done through consultation with the electrical and
                  plumbing service areas as these sectors are interrelated in many aspects.</p>

                <li>HVAC equipment (chillers & DX)</li>
                <p> Mechanical services mainly deal with HVAC in residential and
                  commercial buildings. It includes air conditioning system, space
                  heating and ventilation. These systems are mandatory in construction
                  as they control the humidity and indoor temperature and supply fresh
                  air through ventilation. Services under HVAC include furnaces, heat
                  pumps, ductwork and other home comfort services. Its significance
                  comes down to providing good indoor air quality.
                  HVAC works are done by considering equipment capacity & quality,
                  Size and compatibility, installing heat distribution systems correctly for
                  air ducts, steam piping, refrigerant lines etc. Ensuring indoor air quality
                  requires the removal of moisture, odour, smoke, airborne bacteria
                  through the correct systems and apparatus. Our team of experts keep
                  in mind the nine essential parts of an HVAC system namely air return,
                  exhaust, filter, ducts, electrical elements, outdoor units, coils and
                  blower. Along with HVAC installation and services, we also provide
                  maintenance services such as clean coils and filters, emergency
                  repairs, and check-ups to function longer and efficiently.
                  We make sure the three essentials are met by our HVAC services.
                  Keeping you warm during winters, cool during summers and making
                  sure your indoor air quality is fresh to keep you healthy and safe. Our
                  team will provide the best work and maintenance by working with
                  modern equipment and methods under the correct guidelines so that
                  there are no air quality issues in the future.
                </p>
                <li>Ducting fabrication & insulation</li>
                <p>We provide ductwork fabrication for the processing equipment and ducts that
                  are an integral part of the HVAC system. Since itâ€™s an important part of HVAC,
                  it ensures an adequate supply of conditioned air throughout the house. There
                  should be a proper consideration while choosing the type of ducts needed for
                  various systems. We have fibreglass lined air ducts, fibreboard air ducts,
                  sheet metal air ducts and flexible air ducts. Our team helps you to choose the
                  right ductwork for your cooling system. We provide the correct size ductwork
                  for your building needs, we make sure there is an equal supply of airflow in &
                  out. We look into common & effective design while choosing a duct
                  configuration along with ductwork installation and insulation.
                  In HVAC ducting we use galvanised steel or aluminium and are commonly
                  lined with fibreglass for insulation. It needs to have a good tolerance level to
                  maintain system pressure which affects its efficiency and performance. We
                  work by the saying that the support system holding the ductwork in place
                  makes all the difference.</p>
                <li>Testing and commissioning</li>
                <p>Since we undertake all phases of a construction project, project
                  commissioning and testing is an integral part of our services. Through
                  it, we ensure all the structural components and systems of a
                  construction project are designed, installed, tested, operated and
                  maintained according to the requirements of the client. It is usually
                  done after the installation phase to ensure everything is performing its
                  function efficiently.
                  The objective of this stage is to hand over the completed project to the
                  client by guaranteeing its safety, performance and an orderly list of
                  components and works done for future use. This is a crucial process
                  and our team ensures that a construction project & its systems function
                  as intended during the design phase and deliver the required
                  performance and checkups are done without leaving any detail for
                  further consideration.
                  <li>Fire fighting</li>
                  <p>A project is only complete if it has the required safety apparatus
                    installed to save the occupants in it. A project should be able to
                    counter any safety challenges and we make sure that it is done
                    through careful consideration by providing fire fighting systems
                    and installation services.
                    Under this service, we provide fire storage tanks for water
                    storage, a specialised pumping system and a network of pipes

                  functionality, the needs it has to deliver and how to optimise its overall
                  performance. Electrical designing involves planning, creating, testing
                  and supervising the installation and development of electrical
                  equipment including lighting, power systems and distribution along with
                  communications infrastructure. During the designing process, the
                  control systems of devices such as batteries and their functionality are
                  also considered. We undertake electrical designing projects of various
                  capacities to go on to the next level of the projectâ€™s construction
                  phases.

                <li>Lighting and power distribution system</li>
                <p>Apart from electrical designing, we also provide lighting and power distribution
                  systems integral to any construction project. We undertake radial, loop and
                  network power distribution systems according to the clientâ€™s need and project
                  requirement. We have a basic power distribution system for smaller buildings
                  and provision of higher electrical load for huge buildings and projects with
                  multiple transformers. </p>
                  <p>
                  When it comes to lighting we have ambient lighting for general purposes and
                  for a uniform source of illumination. We provide task lighting where brighter
                  light for a specific focal point is required. And accent lighting for highlighting a
                  certain feature or to get the desired effect for a space. Under these
                  categories, we provide the installation of chandeliers, wall-mounted fixtures,
                  track lights, spotlight, hanging fixtures, pendant lighting, directional gimbal,
                  tape and extrusion to name a few. In our lighting projects, we go from generic
                  to specific lighting approaches so that the lighting need of a particular space is
                  met. We have lighting solutions with various types to choose from to enhance
                  the ambience of your abode. </p>
                  <p>
                  Power distribution depends on the building type, the loads required and the
                  dimension and length of supply cables. We provide vertical and horizontal
                  supply systems for rising mains and each floor level. We have various
                  arrangements to choose from such as radial and loop system, secondary
                  selective system, sparing transformer system, composite systems and
                  secondary spot network. We will help you choose the best arrangement for
                  the electrical distribution system as it has an impact on the reliability and
                  maintenance of the systems. </p>
                  <p>
                  Under electrical substation, we have a subsidiary station which regulates
                  voltage to take care of system voltage changes. We undertake the setting up
                  of substations of varying scales such as step-up, primary, distribution,
                  industrial, converter substations etc. we ensure the highest reliability and
                  performance by reducing the heat, eddy currents and other transmission
                  losses. We make it easier to distribute electricity and make the supply safe
                  and easy. </p>
                 <p>
                  Installation of switchgear is an important part of controlling an electrical
                  power system. Under switchgear devices, we have fuses, circuit breakers,
                  isolators, relays, potential transformers, lightning arresters etc. it is directly
                  linked to the supply system and its main function is to regulate the equipment
                  for testing, maintenance and clearing the fault. We provide protection to the
                  lines to prevent damage due to heavy current flow. We undertake both
                  outdoor and indoor type switchgear. </p>
                  <p>
                  Transformers and generators are an integral part of any electrical power
                  system as they generate current and convert between current and voltage.
                  We will ensure it has good mechanical strength to counter short circuit
                  challenges and will also make sure the heating condition of the windings
                  satisfy standard requirements. We provide transformers with an efficient core
                  to do the work. We have different types of transformers to choose from.
                  In the digital age, keeping your information secure is of utmost priority. We
                  also provide UPS security to keep your hardware, data centres and
                  telecommunication equipment safe and secure so that your personal
                  information is not at risk. Installing a UPS can be of benefit as they protect
                  against power problems, security and data breach. We will help you in
                  deciding which UPS is right for your requirement depending on the loads it
                  needs to protect all by testing your critical power system.
                  HV/LV is important for a large scale project or establishment as it alters the
                  voltage according to the requirement of the equipment. It gives you an
                  efficient energy system as it switches between high and low voltages.</p>
                  <p>
                  The
                  HV/LV installation comes along with our transformers and switchgear
                  installation if required as it is considered an electrical upgrade. If a complex
                  electrical power system is in place then HV/LV should be considered as it will
                  increase the performance of the system. </p>
                  <p>
                  Structured data cabling is a significant part of a robust telecommunications
